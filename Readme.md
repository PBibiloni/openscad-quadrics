# OpenSCAD - Quadrics

Python scripts to create meshes of quadratic surfaces. The meshes are exported to a OpenSCAD script, which can then generate a .STL.

The generated scripts and meshes are stored in the repository (`scad` and `stl` folders, respectively).

## Installation

Python version 3.12.0 or higher. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
